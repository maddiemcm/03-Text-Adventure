WELCOME TO XXX
(a generally unadvisable game for indecisive players)

What exactly is xxx you ask and why should you play it?

    I'm so glad you asked! XXX is a text adventure game that takes place in a fairly small kingdom in some fantasy realm, entirely defined by the limits of the user's imagination. As the creator, I gave some description to each location featured in the game to give the player a basic understanding of what they were encountering, but what those locations truly look like is entirely up to the player. You could imagine the world in minecraft style, classic manga black and white, or if you're really feeling it, maybe even a cartoon style like the Simpsons (if you are capable of making art depicting this please contact me I would love to see that.) 

    The basic goal of the game (not at all influenced by Mario, Peach and Donkey kong - I swear it) is to rescue the princess. Sort of. Play it and you'll see :)

    I threw in some fun little dialogue between the user's character and other characters in the game to give it a real sense of personality and also to better sculpt the world and plotline. I hope you enjoy this because it was definitely my favorite florish to add.

So... Gameplay?

    If you have never played a text adventure game, like I hadn't until about a week ago, the basic functionality is that you, the user, must make decisions that guide your character through a series of rooms and challenges to reach the end goal or just finish the plot line. In many text adventure games, if you mess up, you die. I didn't want this game to so much take on an angle of survival so much as a feeling of exploration and quirky task completion. So, more likely than not, if you mess up you won't die. This isn't gauranteed, however; so don't get too comfy!

    To make these decisions, you simply type in a "verb", all of which I will provide at the end of this page in case your problem solving skills consist heavily of relying on others to do the brunt work (been there - only partial judgement.) Do feel free to try out different phrases and just go with whatever feels natural. I've programmed several responses per each decision. Some are quite a bit sarcastic.
